<p>The age at which you choose to start to draw money from your pension has a significant impact on the amount of money you will receive. If you retire early, there will be less money in your pension pot and you will receive a smaller pension.

<message><![CDATA[<p><b><font color='#06038d'>Tax free cash</font></b></p>
<p>You can take up to 25% of your pension pot as a tax free lump sum.</p>
<p>This is capped at 25% of the current LTA (Lifetime  Allowance) determined by the Government. Anything above that will be taxed at your normal rate.</p>
<p>If your pension pot exceeds the current LTA value, your cash lump sum will be capped accordingly in this calculator.</p>]]></message>
