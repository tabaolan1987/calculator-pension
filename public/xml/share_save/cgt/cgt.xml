<h4>Capital Gains Tax</h4>
<p>Assuming that your full Capital Gains Tax allowance is available, you will only need to pay tax if your profit exceeds Â£11,100.</p>
<p>You may have other chargeable assets that could impact your remaining allowance. If you are not sure, please speak to a financial advisor.</p>
