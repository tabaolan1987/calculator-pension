<h4>Important information</h4>
<p>This calculator is designed to reflect the length of time your expected retirement income will last based on the information you provide to us.</p>
 
<p>All figures are based on a number of <a href="">important assumptions</a> about the future.  The actual pension you receive in retirement could be higher or lower than the results provided in this calculator.</p>
 
<p>The figures provide an illustration and are not guaranteed. Your final pension fund and the income available will depend on various factors including the growth of your pension fund, contributions you make prior to retirement, your retirement age, inflation, charges and annuity rates of the annuity product you select.</p>
 
<p>The value of investments and the income from them may fall as well as rise and is not guaranteed. The performance information set out herein refers to the past. Past performance is not a reliable indicator of future results.</p>
 
<p>This calculator does not include state pension entitlements.</p>
 
<p>Your pension may be affected by the Lifetime Allowance and/or personal allowance limits set out by HMRC.  For further information, please speak to a pension specialist or a financial adviser.</p>

<h4>Assumptions used</h4>
<p><b>Inflation</b> – when calculating how regular contributions might increase, inflation is assumed to be</p>
 <ul>
<li>0.5% if investment growth is 2%.</li>
<li>2.5% if investment growth is 5%.</li>
<li>4.5% if investment growth is 8%.</li>
 </ul>
<p>This calculator defaults to an investment growth rate of 5% unless otherwise specified in the advanced options. These assumptions are set down by the Financial Conduct Authority for pension projections.</p>
<p><b>Life expectancy</b> - this calculator uses life expectancy based on 2012 population projections developed by the Office for National Statistics.</p>
